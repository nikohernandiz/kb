TEASER
FADE IN:
CLOSE-UP: the ruggedly handsome, sweat-slick face of our hero,
STERLING ARCHER. His cold steel-blue eyes smolder with hatred.
KGB COLONEL (O.S.)
Sterling Archer, codename Duchess...
We hear a MATCH struck. Its flare plays across Archer's face,
its light pulses as we hear a CIGAR being puffed. We are in:
1 INT. STONE DUNGEON -- CONTINUOUS
Ancient stone walls weeping with moisture. Inky shadows, a
faint and far-off scream. A sinister, uniformed KGB COLONEL,
50ish, savors both the aroma of his Cuban cigar and this moment.
KGB COLONEL
Known, from Berlin to Bangkok, as
the world's most dangerous spy. So
for us, this is... how you say?
REVEAL: Archer, sweaty and clad only in a tight pair of Daniel
Craig-ian boxer-briefs, three puckered BULLET SCARS visible on
his lean muscular chest, SHACKLED by his wrists to the WALL.
KGB COLONEL
A "good get."
(puffs cigar)
But not so good for you, Mr. Archer.
Because you heff information that I
want. And is maybe old cliché, but...
The colonel raises two JUMPER CABLE LEADS, sparks them together.
KGB COLONEL
We heff ways of making you talk.
Archer cocks an eyebrow. We follow his gaze to a CART which
holds a DRY CELL BATTERY, wired to the menacing JUMPER LEADS.
ARCHER
What, your little go-cart battery?
KGB COLONEL
Golf cart.
ARCHER
Whatever, and would you pick an accent
and stick with it?
Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt") REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09 2
The "colonel," who is actually CRENSHAW, an ISIS agent (with
an American accent) waves a JUMPER CLAMP at Archer's face.
CRENSHAW
Listen here, you little --
MALORY (O.S.)
Son of a bitch!
ARCHER
Oh, great --
CRENSHAW
Now you did it.
SHUNK, SHUNK! Several FLUORESCENT LIGHTS come on. We are in:
2 INT. DUNGEON/CONFERENCE ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
The "dungeon" is an elaborate mock-up in an office building
conference room. The MANHATTAN SKYLINE is visible outside,
and one wall has a large TWO-WAY MIRROR, through which we see:
MALORY ARCHER, director of ISIS. She's watching this from her
adjoining office, glaring over her nth TOM COLLINS of the day.
She is about 60 and impeccably styled, heels to hair; though
still beautiful, she radiates an air of steel-clad hardassness.
MALORY
What is the point of these simulations --
ARCHER
Crenshaw's arousal?
MALORY
-- if you don't take them seriously?!
ARCHER
How can I? Between his lame accent
and the go-cart battery --
CRENSHAW
Golf cart!
ARCHER
Shut up! And speaking of lame, my
codename --
MALORY
Was chosen at random by the ISIS
computer!
Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt") REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09 3
ARCHER
Random?! It was your dog's name!
MALORY
Ohh, Duchess...
Malory picks up a FRAMED PHOTO from the table: a (surprisingly
tasteful) B/W PHOTO of a slightly younger, NUDE Malory, posing
amid silk sheets with her dear departed AFGHAN HOUND, Duchess.
MALORY
I loved her so much...
ARCHER
That it was creepy and pathetic?
Malory lowers the photo, turns her icy glare back to Archer.
MALORY
And if you were half as smart as she
was, I --
ARCHER
She wasn't too smart to die from
eating chocolate! Was she?!
MALORY
[gasps, then] Exercise terminated!
ARCHER
Okay, that's lunch then!
MALORY
Agent performance: unsatisfactory!
SHUNK! The lights return to "dungeon" setting.
ARCHER
Oh, come -- at worst that was "Needs
Improvement!"
CRENSHAW
Jesus, you think this is a game?
ARCHER
I think Jenga's a game, and --
CRENSHAW
What if I'd been real KGB?!
ARCHER
I assume you'd be trying to suck a
promotion out of some Russian guy's
cock...
Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt") REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09 4
This hits home. Crenshaw menaces Archer with a JUMPER CLAMP.
CRENSHAW
Well maybe, I never get promoted --
ARCHER
And never will --
CRENSHAW
-- because my mommy's not the boss!
ARCHER
And maybe, you just got your face
kicked off!
WHOOSH! Archer launches a deadly KARATE KICK, stops his foot
mere inches away from Crenshaw's face, and HOLDS it there.
ARCHER
That is my foot in your face! Smell
the embarrassment! Graagh!
ZZRRPT! Crenshaw SHOCKS Archer's foot with the JUMPER CLAMP.
Archer's spasm breaks the shackles, he CRASHES out of frame.
ARCHER
Mother, did you see that?!
3 INT. MALORY'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS
We are OTS on Malory. Through the TWO-WAY MIRROR, distant and
out of focus, Crenshaw looms over the crumpled heap of Archer.
What is in focus is the translucent reflection of Malory's
face, taking this all in as she raises her Collins glass...
ARCHER (O.S.)
Mother? Mother!
... and grinning devilishly to camera, as we CUT TO:
4 MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE -- (:45)
Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt") REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09 5
ACT ONE
5 INT. ARCHER'S BEDROOM -- MORNING -- ONE WEEK LATER
In this impossibly cool penthouse, a PHONE begins to ring.
The camera moves through the huge, sunlit bedroom, past empty
bottles of CHAMPAGNE, high HEELS, a BRA, a STEWARDESS UNIFORM.
On the BED: a PUG licks FOIE GRAS from a silver plate, at the
feet of a breathaking French STEWARDESS, asleep in the nude.
Archer sleeps beside her, also nude, save for a thick BANDAGE
wrapped around his foot. An ANSWERING MACHINE picks up.
ARCHER (on machine)
Leave a message at the tone. Tone.
VOICE (on phone)
Hello? This is Four-Five-Six Laundry.
Your shirts are ready. For a week.
ARCHER
Ugh, no!
STEWARDESS
Mmmm, good morning.
ARCHER
Hey, you.
STEWARDESS
I am so hungry --
ARCHER
You are famished.
STEWARDESS
-- mmmm.
ARCHER
Okay gimme five minutes on my backhand,
then we'll see if there's --
(sees dog, yells)
-- a dog dog dog dog! Is that a
dog?! In my home?!
The PUG, understandably upset by the shouts, starts to BARK.
STEWARDESS
Oui, that is Abelard!
Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt") REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09 6
ARCHER
Ohh adorable, get the hell out!
STEWARDESS
[gasp] But you promised me breakfast!
ARCHER
You want breakfast, try the diner.
You're obviously into Greek.
(beat)
Get it?!
The dog BARKS.
ARCHER
Thank you, Abelard.
6 INT. ARCHER'S PENTHOUSE -- TERRACE -- A BIT LATER
Archer, in shirt, tie, and shoulder holster, sits at a large
breakfast-laden TABLE. His elderly, long-suffering English
butler, WOODHOUSE, pours Archer's coffee with weary resignation.
ARCHER
It's a short list, Woodhouse.
WOODHOUSE
Yes, sir --
ARCHER
The two things we don't allow in
here. What are they?
WOODHOUSE
Dogs and your mother --
ARCHER
Short list, isn't it?
WOODHOUSE
Yes, but --
ARCHER
What.
WOODHOUSE
You were quite --
ARCHER
What? What was I?
WOODHOUSE
-- insistent an exception be made.
Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt") REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09 7
FLASHBACK: NIGHT BEFORE
Archer, shitfaced and disheveled, one arm around Stewardess,
the other hand holding the PUG, yells drunkenly at Woodhouse.
ARCHER
Because forget the dog rule, because
this pug! Is amazing! Look, watch
this! Abegard, go!
(barks with dog)
Roo roo, roof! Do you not hear that?!
That's "Puttin' On The Ritz" man!
BACK TO SCENE
ARCHER
I'm always insistent.
WOODHOUSE
Yes sir.
ARCHER
But I'm not to be trusted.
WOODHOUSE
No sir.
ARCHER
That's what I pay you for.
WOODHOUSE
About my last paycheck, sir --
ARCHER
Stop! Stop. I have to go. But if
I find one single dog hair when I
get back, I'll... rub sand in your
dead little eyes.
WOODHOUSE
Very good, sir.
ARCHER
I also need you to go buy sand.
WOODHOUSE
Yes sir.
ARCHER
I don't know if they grade it,
but... coarse.
Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt") REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09 8
7 EXT. FOUR-FIVE-SIX LAUNDRY -- ESTABLISHING -- LATER
A nondescript storefront laundry, which takes up the ground
floor of an equally nondescript Midtown office building.
8 INT. FOUR-FIVE-SIX LAUNDRY -- CONTINUOUS
Archer, now in a sleek gray suit, barely breaks stride as he
snatches a pressed SHIRT from RAJAN, the 50ish, Indian, kurtaclad
laundry owner, and heads toward the tumbling DRYERS.
RAJAN
One entire whole week we have been
calling you. Highly unprofessional.
ARCHER
Really? Because I find your
sweatiness unprofessional....
Archer presses a BUTTON on a dryer. The whole machine, STILL
TUMBLING, slides open like an elevator door.
ARCHER
So we have something else in common,
besides the fact that now both of
our shirts reek of curry.
Archer enters the elevator as Rajan waves a LAUNDRY BILL.
RAJAN
And when will you settle your account?
ARCHER
When will you buy some dress shields?
RAJAN
This is not a dress!
ARCHER
That's not a dress! Are you serious?!
The "door" closes. Rajan wipes his sweaty forehead, sighs.
RAJAN
But he is right, I perspire a great
deal. Who would not, in such a place?
The irons, especially, get very hot...
A mischievous smile spreads across his face as we CUT TO:
Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt") REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09 9
9 INT. ELEVATOR -- CONTINUOUS
In spite of its "secret dryer" entrance, the elevator is
otherwise normal. Its SECURITY CAMERA looks down on Archer.
He holds up his expensive, tailored SHIRT: it has a large,
unmistakably iron-shaped SCORCH MARK right across the front.
ARCHER
Oh, that's... that's a burned shirt.
10 INT. ISIS HEADQUARTERS -- BULLPEN -- CONTINUOUS
The retro-mod ISIS office takes up an entire floor. Offices
ring the central "bullpen," which is a sea of DESKS. Only a
few have PEOPLE at them, typing on clunky, 1980's COMPUTERS.
The ELEVATOR opens. Archer strides out toward camera. As he
passes the desks' few occupants, their reactions show their
opinions of him: glares from the women, fingers from the men.
Archer FLINGS his ruined SHIRT in the FACE of one of them.
ARCHER
Here's a shirt, stupid.
He stops. CUE sultry MUSIC as we CUT TO HIS POV, SLO-MO, of:
LANA KANE: Archer's ex. She's about 30, with deep sloe eyes,
an impossibly gorgeous mixed-race complexion, and an islandtinged
British accent that would melt a framing hammer. She
is BUTTONING up her BLOUSE as she walks out of the COPY ROOM.
ARCHER
Lana, hey...!
LANA
(chummy)
Archer! Finally back to work?
ARCHER
Yeah, I --
LANA
Great, yeah! Because go fuck yourself!
Lana breezes off, as Archer yells after her perfect backside.
ARCHER
Oh rea -- after all that HR mediation?
Really? All the hard work Pam did?
FIGGIS (O.S.)
Is that Archer?
Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt") REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09 10
ARCHER
God damn it!
CYRIL FIGGIS – mid-30's, pasty, in a SWEATER VEST – emerges
from the COPY ROOM tucking his SHIRT TAIL into his pants with
one hand, and holding a thick MANILA FOLDER with the other.
FIGGIS
Archer, hey --
ARCHER
No, Cyril. Go away.
FIGGIS
Listen, about your operations account --
ARCHER
Not -- Cyril, not now --
FIGGIS
Yes, now. You've got some serious --
(lowers voice)
Discrepancies in your account. Now
I'm sure you wouldn't use operational
funds for personal expenses...
11 RAPID-FIRE MONTAGE: ARCHER BLOWING MONEY
Shots of Archer blowing money at casinos, upscale tailors, and
high-end car dealers. On champagne, horses, hookers. We end
on Archer in a casino at the ROULETTE TABLE, sweaty and tie
askew, as the MARBLE dances and flirts right over 22 BLACK...
ARCHER
Come on twenty-two black, twenty-two --
And then drops into 18 RED.
ARCHER
Black! Ass! Son of a bitch!
REVEAL: a huge, distinguished AFRICAN MAN in dashiki and kufi
is standing there, holding a MARTINI and glaring at Archer.
ARCHER
My best friend is black! I should
call him! He's a great guy. I love
great black guys.
BACK TO SCENE 
Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt") REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09 11
ARCHER
That is a very serious implication.
FIGGIS
Well so is embezzlement.
ARCHER
Oh! No, okay yeah, let's talk about
the elephant in the room!
FIGGIS
That you're embezzling, or...?
ARCHER
That you! Are screwing my ex!
FIGGIS
Oh, for Chri --
ARCHER
Huh?!
FIGGIS
Archer please, that's private!
ARCHER
What? Is that not common knowl --
(to the room)
You all know about Cyril and Lana,
right?! Of course! Because if Pam
knows, everybody knows! Right, Pam?!
In the doorway of her office, PAM, the chubby, mousy H.R. rep,
is busted gawking at Archer's scene. She ducks her head back.
ARCHER
HR mediations are supposed to be
confidential, Pam! You... manatee!
(to Cyril)
And as for you...! Good day, sir.
Archer stalks off, leaving a confused Cyril to call after him.
FIGGIS
Hey wait! What about your acc --
(to himself)
Oh, I get it. See what he did there,
Cyril? Classic misdirection.
Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt") REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09 12
12 EXT. MALORY'S OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER
Outside the corner office, CHERYL - 26, very pretty - types
on her computer while trying, unsuccessfully, not to cry. She
looks up in surprise to see Archer standing at her tidy desk.
ARCHER (O.S.)
No, you're so ugly when you cry...
CHERYL
[gasps, then] Mr. Archer!
ARCHER
I'm fine, is she in, or out eating a
baby?
CHERYL
You stood me up again last night!
ARCHER
Last--? Yeah, what happened was, did
you see "Brian's Song?" Same thing,
pretty much happened. I helped a guy
with cancer. Look, I'm sorry, Carol.
CHERYL
[gasps, then] It's Cheryl.
ARCHER
I know, Ca -- Cheryl. So to make it
up to you...
CHERYL
[cleansing breath, then] I'm ready.
ARCHER
Could you buzz me in.
CHERYL
Is that all you have to say?!
ARCHER
Yes?
13 INT. MALORY'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS
Huge office. A wall of windows overlooks Midtown Manhattan,
the retro furnishings are accented in a "rich world traveler"
motif: African masks, Asian carvings, Persian... whatevers.
Malory is on the PHONE at her desk. We're very glad the desk
is there, as it appears she is pleasuring herself beneath it.
Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt") REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09 13
MALORY
Now tell me again, how... no, not
that part, go back? Yes, the pepper.
Oh yes God. Oh God! Oh God! Oh --
Her eyes flutter open and she sees, with us: Archer, in the
open doorway, his mouth agape, his eyes like dinner plates.
MALORY
God! Damn it!
(slams phone down)
What the hell are you doing?!
Archer, goggle-eyed and afraid of the answer, almost whispers:
ARCHER
What are you doing?
MALORY
I -- I'm --
(retakes control)
Wondering how you spent your vacation.
Archer is at the credenza. He's mixed a very stiff COCKTAIL,
and is currently pouring it down his throat with shaky hands.
ARCHER
Vacation?!
MALORY
Where did you go? Whore Island?
ARCHER
I -- that, no! That was sick leave.
MALORY
Vacation.
ARCHER
I was wounded in the line of duty!
MALORY
By a go-cart battery.
ARCHER
Golf cart! Maybe pay attention.
Malory picks up a MANILA FOLDER, savoring what's coming...
MALORY
Oh, I do...
ARCHER
Do you?
Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt") REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09 14
MALORY
And I've just been paying very close
attention to your operations account.
ARCHER
No!
MALORY
Yes.
ARCHER
No!
MALORY
Yes!
ARCHER
Not to worry!
MALORY
Mm hmm...
ARCHER
Mother, my account is square!
MALORY
It better be. You know what happens
to agents I catch stealing...
14 MONTAGE: THREE QUICK HITS -- MANHATTAN -- NIGHT
Three quick scenes - a car, a stoop, a sidewalk - and in each
one, a different DRONE AGENT begs piteously for his life:
DRONE AGENT
No no, please! Noooo --
PHUT PHUT PHUT! Each man's cries are cut short by shots from
a silenced PISTOL, wielded by a grim, trench-coated Crenshaw.
15 INT. MALORY'S OFFICE -- BACK TO PRESENT -- CONTINUOUS
ARCHER
(drinks, coughs liquor)
Wow, that's strong. Yes I do.
MALORY
Well then let me give you some
heartfelt, motherly advice...
Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt") REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09 15
ARCHER
Motherly ad -- are you having a stroke?
MALORY
You wish.
ARCHER
Yeah but seriously: do you smell toast?
MALORY
I smell a rat!
ARCHER
So not toast --
MALORY
And if your account isn't square by
Monday, I'll close it permanently.
Is that clear?
ARCHER
Are you -- you're looking for the
answer "Yes"?
MALORY
Yes.
ARCHER
Then yes.
MALORY
Good. Then get out. And for God's
sake, take a shower. Smells like a
whorehouse in here.
ARCHER
Okay, your own fingers.
MALORY
Hm?
ARCHER
Nothing! Ahem. Johnny Bench called.
END ACT ONE
Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt") REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09 16
ACT TWO
16 EXT. MAINFRAME DOOR -- LATER
We are MID-SHOT on Archer, who addresses camera: determined.
ARCHER
So here's the thing: I need to access
my operations account, and you're
preventing that. Now we can do this
easy, or we can do it hard.
(raises gun)
Your call. No? Hard it is, then!
Archer points his GUN at camera, and... PHUT PHUT PHUT PHUT!
just about empties his entire clip. During which we reveal
that he is actually shooting at THE BULLETPROOF MAINFRAME DOOR.
Bullets go ricocheting off in every direction, and we hear:
DRONE AGENT (O.S.)
Agh! Jesus Christ, Archer!
Archer stops firing, looks off-screen, almost embarrassed.
ARCHER
Ooh, sorry! I forgot that the --
did I get you?
DRONE AGENT (O.S.)
What the is wrong with you?!
ARCHER
Me? Nothing! You, on the other
hand... have a bullet inside you!
CRENSHAW (O.S.)
I see the foot's all better...
Archer turns to find Crenshaw, gloating over his coffee mug.
ARCHER
And I see you're still a hatchetfaced
prick. So...
CRENSHAW
Mmm. Do you see that sign?
ARCHER
Uh, do you see that sign?
REVEAL: a SIGN reading "NO FOOD OR DRINK IN THIS AREA"
Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt") REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09 17
CRENSHAW
Well --
SMACK! Archer SMACKS Crenshaw's COFFEE out of his hands.
ARCHER
That's why. So we don't get ants.
As Crenshaw puzzles this, Archer shoots his cuffs and exits.
17 INT. PAM'S OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER
Chubby, mousy PAM sits behind her tchotchke-covered desk with
a DOLPHIN PUPPET on her hand, addressing BRIEGER, the spooky,
fierce-eyed scientist in charge of the ISIS "gadget lab."
PAM
Because when your co-workers put
food in the refrigerator, that's a
bond of trust. And if you violate
that trust, or the food, there's --
ARCHER (O.S.)
There's my favorite section head!
Archer is in the door, with a box of DONUTS. Pam glares.
PAM
I am dealing with the break room
problem!
ARCHER
Oh, you caught the... wait, I had
something for this. "Pita Predator!"
PAM
Ya know what--?
ARCHER
Sorry yeah, let's just call it what
it is: "Food Rapist."
Brieger glares at Archer, who smiles chummily at Pam.
ARCHER
And Pam, if you want some food that's
supposed to be cream-filled, I offer
these delicious donuts!
PAM
Yeah?
ARCHER
In exchange for a favor --
Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt") REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09 18
PAM
A favor?!
ARCHER
Yeah.
PAM
After how you treated me?!
18 FLASHBACK: PAM'S OFFICE -- H.R. MEDIATION SESSION
Lana tries to pull Archer off a screaming Pam, as he clutches
her throat and BASHES her in the head with the DOLPHIN PUPPET.
ARCHER
Well fuck your dolphin, Pam! Fuck
your fucking dolphin! And fuck you!
LANA
Archer! Get off her, you -- Archer!
[and also various struggling sounds]
BACK TO SCENE
PAM
I had to get three stitches!
ARCHER
And I broke my watch. And I'm sorry
for that.
PAM
Three!
ARCHER
But I need your help, Pam. Because
I... am... conducting a mole hunt.
PAM
[gasps]
ARCHER
Gasp you should. Because if you let
me in the mainframe, I'll drop these
donuts! Then you can pretend they're
marbles, and you're a hungry, hungry...
Pam gasps and... SLAM! Slams her door in Archer's face.
ARCHER
Hungry hippo.
Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt") REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09 19
19 INT. ISIS HEADQUARTERS -- BULLPEN -- MOMENTS LATER
Archer, still holding the DONUT BOX, heads past the desks.
Coming at him from the other direction, and glaring, is Lana.
ARCHER
Lana! Hey look, I dunno if you're
mad at me, or just my ivory-smooth b --
KROOMP! Without breaking stride, Lana smacks the DONUT BOX
out of Archer's hands, sending donuts flying everywhere.
ARCHER
(yells after her)
Oh, is that what you want?! Ants?!
Because that's how you get ants!
20 INT. CYRIL'S OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER
Archer leans into Cyril's doorway, all shit-eating grins.
ARCHER
There's my favorite section head!
FIGGIS
What do you want?
ARCHER
To apologize, Cyril. For my behavior.
FIGGIS
Oh, well --
ARCHER
And also to what are you doing?
REVEAL: Cyril is prepping a STIR-FRY: he's got a cutting board,
CLEAVER, loads of VEGETABLES in various stages of chopped-ness.
FIGGIS
Oh! Just dicing veggies for dinner.
I always make Lana stir-fry on Friday.
ARCHER
Neat, listen --
FIGGIS
Guess what we call it!
ARCHER
(bored: it's obvious)
Stir Friday.
Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt") REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09 20
FIGGIS
Wow.
ARCHER
Yeah.
FIGGIS
That's actually better.
ARCHER
All yours! So let me in the mainframe.
FIGGIS
Is this about your operations account?
ARCHER
No! I -- Cyril!
FIGGIS
Yeah?
ARCHER
I'm on a top-secret mole hunt.
FIGGIS
Oh yeah, Pam mentioned that.
ARCHER
Wh--? When?
FIGGIS
Well, she called a minute ago --
ARCHER
Great --
FIGGIS
-- you know how Pam loves to gossip.
ARCHER
Yeah, and eat rug-marbles, I know,
so... come let me in the mainframe.
FIGGIS
(picks up phone)
Okay, but I need to confirm this with
your mother...
ARCHER
No! No. What if she's the mole?
Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt") REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09 21
FIGGIS
Right.
ARCHER
Think about it.
FIGGIS
Your own mother.
ARCHER
Think what that would do to me.
FIGGIS
Archer...
ARCHER
If we had to kill her.
FIGGIS
Archer...
ARCHER
By stabbing her wrinkly neck.
FIGGIS
Yeah. I can't let you in there.
ARCHER
Can't? Or won't.
FIGGIS
Either?
ARCHER
And after I gave you "Stir Friday."
FIGGIS
Yeah, that is much better. But if
you want to access the mainframe, I
guess you'd have to break in.
CUE DRAMATIC MUSIC as we PUSH IN to Archer's scheming face.
ARCHER
Break into the ISIS mainframe...!
CUT DRAMATIC MUSIC as we CUT BACK TO Cyril chopping veggies.
FIGGIS
Which is obviously ludicrous.
(holds up baby corn)
As is this baby corn. Archer?
Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt") REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09 22
REVEAL: Cyril's office is utterly devoid of Archer.
FIGGIS
Archer?!
ARCHER
Cyril, I'm busy.
21 MONTAGE: THE PLAN
A Michael Bay-worthy helicopter shot of the ISIS headquarters,
the night skyline of Manhattan illuminated in the background.
ARCHER (V.O.)
ISIS Headquarters. Makes Fort Knox
look like a gingerbread house. Only
two means of ingress. The first, at
street level, impenetrable after six...
IN THE LAUNDRY: the CLOCK on the wall reads 6:00. We RACK
ZOOM OUT (through the window) to the sidewalk, where Rajan
releases the ROLL-UP DOOR, which crashes down with a CRASH.
ARCHER (V.O.)
The second, through an access door on
the roof, inexplicably unprotected...
ON THE ROOF: an access DOOR sags open. We RACK ZOOM OUT to
the opposite ROOF: Archer, in black, peers through the SCOPE
of a GRAPPLING HOOK GUN, and... SHOONK! Fires the steel hook.
ARCHER (V.O.)
But even if you zip-lined across,
breached the access door, and somehow
made it into ISIS headquarters...
QUICK SHOTS: Archer EASILY zip-lines across. Simply OPENS the
access door. SLIDES down the stairwell banister. Enters the
BULLPEN. Turns on a ceiling full of FLUORESCENT LIGHTS.
ARCHER (V.O.)
You'd still have to find the mainframe.
IN THE BULLPEN: Archer yawns boredly and looks at the door.
ARCHER (V.O.)
But wait, it gets worse...
22 INT. ISIS MAINFRAME ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
A wide shot of the (actually very mundane) mainframe room.
Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt") REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09 23
ARCHER (V.O.)
Inside, there are three countermeasure
systems. The first is pressuresensitive,
in the floor. Even a mouse
triggers it...
We see a MOUSE, on the floor, proudly holding a TORTILLA CHIP.
ARCHER (V.O.)
The second is sound-sensitive.
Anything above a whisper sets it off...
The mouse CRUNCHES the TORTILLA CHIP, then looks to camera.
ARCHER (V.O.)
And the third system is state-of-theart
voice activation.
23 EXT. ISIS MAINFRAME ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
Cyril, holding a TAKE-OUT BAG (from WRAPSODY IN BLUE), speaks
into an INTERCOM on the wall next to the ISIS mainframe DOOR.
FIGGIS
(overly enunciated)
Cyril. Figgis.
24 INT. ISIS MAINFRAME ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
SHOONK! The lights go ON. The door OPENS. The mouse SCRAMS.
25 INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT -- NOON -- SAME DAY
Swanky joint. Archer holds a GLASS of wine, the remnants of a
large, sumptuous MEAL (and FOIL SWAN) on the table before him.
ARCHER
So obviously, it'd be a lot easier
for me if you just disabled all that
when you left work tonight. Somehow.
REVEAL: Cheryl sits opposite him, with only a GLASS OF WATER.
CHERYL
Oooh...
ARCHER
Yeah.
CHERYL
That would make me... uncomfortable.
Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt") REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09 24
ARCHER
God everything makes you uncomfortable!
QUICK FLASHBACKS:
1) Archer and Cheryl in bed. He is "spooned" behind her.
ARCHER
Just the tip?
2) Archer and Cheryl on the rug in front of his fireplace, a
silk sheet across their nudities. He is "spooned" behind her.
ARCHER
Just the tip.
3) Archer and Cheryl on his sofa. She struggles to "give him
the Heisman" as he shoves an ICE CREAM CONE at her mouth.
ARCHER
Just the tip!
BACK TO SCENE
ARCHER
How was I supposed to know you're
lactose-intolerant?
CHERYL
Because I kept screaming it!
ARCHER
Well...!
CHERYL
And this! I'm a secretary, I don't
have access to.. security whatevers.
ARCHER
Then get them from Cyril!
CHERYL
How would I do that?
ARCHER
Seduce him! Or Pam! Or both!
CHERYL
I can't do that!
ARCHER
Can't? Or won't.
Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt") REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09 25
CHERYL
Either!
ARCHER
That's how you wanna play it? Fine!
Archer stands, snatches up his FOIL SWAN, starts to leave.
CHERYL
Are... you gonna pay for your lunch?
ARCHER
Just the tip.
(checks pocket)
Oh. I actually don't have any cash.
He straightens his TIE, waits. Cheryl SIGHS, gets her PURSE.
ARCHER
Can you... get it? Sorry. I also
need cab fare.
CHERYL
[huge, put-upon sigh]
ARCHER
Awww, ugly duckling...
Archer BOINKS her NOSE with the SWAN.
ARCHER
Bawk bawk!
END ACT TWO 
Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt") REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09 26
ACT THREE
26 EXT. ISIS HEADQUARTERS -- NIGHT
That same Michael Bay-esque shot of the ISIS headquarters, the
night skyline of Manhattan illuminated in the background.
ARCHER (O.S.)
So thanks for nothing, Carol. Now I
have to break into ISIS headquarters,
in a nine hundred dollar turtleneck.
27 EXT. OPPOSITE ROOFTOP -- CONTINUOUS
Archer, in all black, aims his large GRAPPLING HOOK GUN.
ARCHER
And if it gets ruined? I'll make
you drink heavy cream, you... Carol!
SHOONK! He FIRES the hook. As it THUNKS home, we CUT TO:
28 EXT. ISIS MAINFRAME ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
Archer is at the door, a black DUFFEL BAG over his shoulder.
ARCHER
Wow, that was actually pretty easy.
Thanks, new turtleneck --
RRRIIP! He shrugs off the DUFFEL BAG, which rips his sleeve.
ARCHER
Oh for -- and thank you, duffel bag!
Jesus, what else could go wrong...?
29 INT. FOUR-FIVE-SIX LAUNDRY -- CONTINUOUS -- JUMP CUTS
The DRYER-ELEVATOR doors close on Crenshaw, who has a GUN. On
the wall, an ALARM SYSTEM auto-dials Lana's phone number...
30 INT. LANA'S APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS
Lana sits at the dining room TABLE, lovingly set for two.
LANA
(calling off-screen)
Because if you have wingtips on, you're
not technically naked.
Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt") REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09 27
FIGGIS (O.S.)
But --
LANA
And plus because I said so, which is
why I'm kinda confused we're still
even discussing this.
Lana's PHONE rings. She pulls it up, answers it.
LANA
Agent Kane.
(listens)
What?! Yes, confirmed!
She turns to Cyril as he enters, in a TOQUE and APRON, proudly
bearing aloft two plates of his lovingly prepared STIR-FRY.
FIGGIS
Confirmed a naughty Nelly's breaking
our after-work phone rules...
LANA
Cyril, there's been a break-in at ISIS!
FIGGIS
Wh-?! You think it's the mole?!
LANA
God, you and Pam! All you two need
are some hair dryers to sit under.
FIGGIS
Pam's alright...
LANA
Now look, I've got to go --
FIGGIS
But it's "Stir Friday!"
LANA
So much better. But if I'm not here...
FIGGIS
Ah.
31 INT. CAR -- MOMENTS LATER
As Cyril speeds through the (curiously repetitive) streets of
Manhattan, Lana screws a SILENCER onto a wicked MACHINE PISTOL.
Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt") REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09 28
FIGGIS
Because after three months of --
whatever it is we're doing, I just
think it's a little weird you can't
leave me alone in your apartment.
LANA
I know I have trust issues! But
it's Archer's fault I'm like this!
FIGGIS
And here we go...
LANA
All those years of his lying, and
cheating, and --
FIGGIS
It's fine. Please.
LANA
Not to mention how messed up he is
about his mother! You know he called
out her name once, while we were f--
FIGGIS
Fiiiine!!
SCREEECH! Cyril locks up the brakes, tires smoking. We are:
32 EXT. FOUR-FIVE-SIX LAUNDRY -- CONTINUOUS
FIGGIS
And here we are. All fine.
LANA
Cyril, please don't be --
BRRRRRRRT! Cyril's PHONE rings. He finds it, raises it.
FIGGIS
Oop! Now who's a naughty Nelly?
(into phone)
Yes, hello?
ARCHER (O.S.)
Hi, who's this?
FIGGIS
(overly enunciated)
Cyril. Figgis.
Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt") REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09 29
33 EXT. ISIS MAINFRAME ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
Archer stands at the mainframe INTERCOM, holding his PHONE.
ARCHER
I'm sorry, did you say Faggis?
FIGGIS (on phone)
No, Figgis.
34 INT. CAR -- CONTINUOUS
ARCHER (O.S.)
What is it?
LANA
Who is it? Better not be Pam...
FIGGIS
Figgis. I was very clear.
BOOP! Archer hangs up and raises the PHONE to the INTERCOM.
ARCHER
Hi! I love cock, and my name is --
FIGGIS (recorded)
Cyril. Figgis.
35 INT. ISIS MAINFRAME ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
SHOONK! The lights go ON. The door OPENS. The mouse SCRAMS.
ARCHER
Holy shit, our security is atrocious.
AT THE DESK
A CLOSE-UP of Archer's HAND turning on the green monochrome
MONITOR. The ISIS logo appears, above a box for a PASSWORD.
Archer, now in the chair, peers at the MONITOR, starts typing.
ARCHER
Password. And the password is...
(types something in)
"Guest."
BOOONG! "Access Granted" appears in large letters onscreen.
Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt") REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09 30
ARCHER
No, it's not -- Jesus Christ. That
is just... Babytown Frolics.
(typing)
Okay, operations account. Just how
deep in the red am I out of my mind?!
(gapes at screen)
How?! Do I spend that much money?!
36 FLASHBACK: ARCHER'S PENTHOUSE -- DAY
Archer admires his new turtleneck in the mirror as Woodhouse
stands behind him, holding a stack of folded identical ones.
ARCHER
Yeah I know it's sexy, Woodhouse,
that's why I bought ten. Now arrange
those by color.
WOODHOUSE
These are... all black.
ARCHER
Oh, are they? Or are five dark black,
and five in a slightly darker black?
BACK TO SCENE
ARCHER
And now I'm short a...
(looks at sleeve)
Slightly darker black one.
(typing, searching)
Sooo, let's just put all my expenses
into... some pathetic idiot's account,
by the name of... oh! Crenshaw!
Suddenly Crenshaw appears in the doorway with his wicked LUGER.
CRENSHAW (O.S.)
Ohhh...
ARCHER
[startled yelp]
CRENSHAW
Now that's not very nice...
Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt") REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09 31
ARCHER
How -- hey! Just talking about you.
CRENSHAW
Oh.
ARCHER
And about how this isn't what it
looks like.
CRENSHAW
Lot of that going around.
ARCHER
Yeah, it's an epidemic.
CRENSHAW
For example, my real name is Kremensky.
ARCHER
Is -- that sounds -- is that Jewish?
CRENSHAW
It's Russian.
ARCHER
Oh! Russian Jewish?
CRENSHAW
I'm the mole, idiot!
ARCHER
Wh--? I made up the mole!
CRENSHAW
Yes, but you told Pam! Who of course
blabbed it all over the office --
ARCHER
God, do we hate Pam?
CRENSHAW
-- and now everyone is looking for a
real mole, so I have to escape.
ARCHER
And irony.
CRENSHAW
But thanks for breaking into the
mainframe for me --
Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt") REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09 32
ARCHER
Oh, double irony.
CRENSHAW
Because I'll need fifty thousand for
travel expenses. From your account.
ARCHER
Fifty thousand?! That's... too much.
CRENSHAW
It's last minute bookings. For two.
ARCHER
Oh.
37 INT. ISIS HEADQUARTERS -- BULLPEN -- MOMENTS LATER
Crenshaw frog-marches Archer to the elevator, GUN at his back.
CRENSHAW
Because when I hand the notorious
Duchess to the KGB, I won't just get
a promotion. I'll get my own dacha.
ARCHER
Yeah, I hear those are nice.
LANA (O.S.)
Too bad you'll never see it.
REVEAL: Lana has him covered with her wicked MACHINE-PISTOL.
CRENSHAW
Wh--?!
Archer seizes on Crenshaw's distraction and CRUNCH! CRACKS his
JAW with his ELBOW, KICKS him out of frame, draws his own GUN.
CRENSHAW
Grrk! Oof!
ARCHER
Lana! Crenshaw's a mole! And his
name's not really Crenshaw, it's
Kremensky! Definitely Russian,
possibly a Jew, I don't know!
(beat)
Thoughts?
Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt") REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09 33
LANA
Yeah, shut up.
(to Crenshaw)
And you: drop it.
CRENSHAW
Or what?
ARCHER
No no, do not wind her up. That is
a big gun, and she is baby-crazy.
LANA
[gasps, then] Baby-crazy?!
ARCHER
(to Crenshaw)
That's why I dumped her.
LANA
You sack of shit! I dumped you,
because you cheated on me!
Archer and Lana get right up in each other's faces.
ARCHER
Yeah, after you went all baby-crazy!
LANA
Oh, that's --
ARCHER
For the babies!
Lana jams her MACHINE PISTOL right up under Archer's chin.
LANA
You wanna see crazy?!
Archer jams his (much smaller) GUN right up under Lana's chin.
ARCHER
No, I've seen it! And spoiler alert!
It ends with a closet full of my suits
on fire!
LANA
I wish you'd been wearing one!
ARCHER
Who would wanna wear an on-fire suit?! 
Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt") REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09 34
LANA
Cosplay enthusiasts! Wait, no! Shit!
ARCHER
Do you even hear?! How totally
batshit insane you sound?!
LANA
I'll tell you what I hear!
BOONG. We hear the ELEVATOR close. They turn as it closes.
LANA
[deep "pre-rant" breath]
ARCHER
Yeah, please keep talking.
38 EXT. FOUR-FIVE-SIX LAUNDRY -- MOMENTS LATER
Malory, straight from bed and hurriedly dressed, stands with
Cyril on the sidewalk in front of the breached laundry door.
MALORY
So why are you sitting down here in
the car, eating... stir-fry?!
FIGGIS
It's Stir-Friday. And Lana said to.
Crenshaw lurches out of the laundry, shocked to see them.
MALORY
Crenshaw?
CRENSHAW
Ms. Archer?!
MALORY
What's this flap about a break-in?!
CRENSHAW
Uh --
Archer and Lana lurch out of the laundry, GUNS drawn.
ARCHER
Mother, look out! Crenshaw's a mole!
MALORY
Oh, Pam's as full of crap as she is
of... carbohydrates. Now -- rrrk!
Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt") REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09 35
Crenshaw grabs Malory from behind, puts his GUN to her head.
CRENSHAW
Not this time, you impossible bitch!
Also, you should all be nicer to Pam.
LANA
I am always nice to her!
FIGGIS
To her face...
LANA
Why aren't you in the car?
MALORY
(being choked)
Rrk! Will somebody... do something?!
Archer GRABS Lana from behind, puts his GUN to her head.
LANA
["just got grabbed" sort of noise]
EVERYBODY
Archer?! What're you doing?! Etc!
LANA
What're you doing, you idiot!
ARCHER
(low, to Lana)
Shut up! It's classic misdirection.
(to Crenshaw)
Looks like we've got a Mexican
standoff, Kremensky!
CRENSHAW
Wh--? How is this a Mexican standoff?
ARCHER
Ummm...
CRENSHAW
I don't care if you shoot her!
ARCHER
Oh.
Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt") REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09 36
LANA
Idiot.
FIGGIS
I do!
CRENSHAW
(cocks pistol)
But what if I shoot her, mama's boy?
Archer cocks a mildly intrigued eyebrow at the prospect...
MALORY
(still being choked)
Sterling...? Sterling!
CRENSHAW
Yes, picture her dead in the gutter,
and what your pathetic life will be
like without old mommie dearest...
LANA
Oh, for -- Jesus Christ!
EVERYBODY
What?! Huh? Etc.
LANA
He's got an erection!
Malory, aghast and furious, rips away from Crenshaw's grasp.
MALORY
What?!
CRENSHAW
-- the hell is wrong with you peopl --
BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM! Four quick shots rip into Crenshaw's
chest, sending his body flying off-screen, away from Malory.
EVERYBODY
Gasp! Ack! What the--?! Etc!
REVEAL: smoke wisps out of Archer's raised GUN.
ARCHER
(overly cool)
Adios, amigo... ow! Ow! Hey!
WHACK! WHACK! Malory starts bashing Archer with her PURSE.
MALORY
An erection?!
Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt") REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09 37
ARCHER
Ow! What is in there, buckles?!
MALORY
The thought of me dead gives you an
erection?!
ARCHER
No, just half of one! The other
half... would've really missed you.
MALORY
[sound of utter contempt]
Malory turns on her heel and storms into the laundry, past
Crenshaw's corpse, lying in a crumpled heap on the ground.
ARCHER
Johnny Bench called...
39 INT. ISIS HEADQUARTERS -- BULLPEN -- MOMENTS LATER
Archer and Lana glare at each other as Cyril reads a COMPUTER
PRINT-OUT and Malory, very distractedly, sips a TOM COLLINS.
FIGGIS
Yeah, see here? Crenshaw just stole
fifty thousand from Archer's account.
Must've been doing it all along...
ARCHER
Apology accepted. Assdouche.
FIGGIS
Hey!
LANA
(raising her gun)
Call him that again.
ARCHER
Make me!
LANA
What?
ARCHER
What? Mother, do you see this?
MALORY
I just don't understand...
ARCHER
Hostile work environment --
Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt") REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09 38
MALORY
I would've known if we had a mole.
Archer, Lana and Cyril all cock suspicious eyebrows at this.
LANA
How?
MALORY
How what, dear?
ARCHER
How could you know if we had a mole?
MALORY
I... errr...
As Malory tries to come up with some explanation, we CUT TO:
40 FLASHBACK: INT. KGB HEADQUARTERS -- EARLIER THAT MORNING
The dreaded Lubyanka. This huge, high-ceilinged office has a
view of Moscow's classic onion domes. Behind an acre-sized
desk sits the burly, bearish MAJOR NIKOLAI JAKOV, 60, the gruff
but loveable head of the KGB, who is currently on the PHONE.
JAKOV
And then I am takink a hot pepper --
MALORY (on phone)
Yes, the pepper! Oh God!
JAKOV
-- and slowly rubbink it around your --
MALORY (on phone)
God damn it!
We hear a very loud CLICK, followed by a dial tone.
JAKOV
Hello? Mooshka?
Jakov hangs up, and looks up to see his SERGEANT eyeing him.
KGB SERGEANT
Who was that?
JAKOV
Who are you? Comrade Questions?
Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt") REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09 39
41 INT. MALORY'S OFFICE -- BACK TO PRESENT -- CONTINUOUS
Malory retakes control of the situation with a good offense:
MALORY
And who are you? Comrade Questions?
ARCHER
Comr--?
MALORY
Oh, shut up. You and your erec --
and why are there donuts everywhere?!
ARCHER
Lana did that.
LANA
I --
MALORY
Do you want ants?! Because that's
how you get ants!
Malory, back in control, gives them all a stern look, and we:
SLAM TO CREDITS
